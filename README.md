# Play-Snakes
The popular snake game which everyone of us have played atleast once in their life. If not then what are you waiting for. Download the repo and get started...

`pip install pygame --pre` to install pygame to your system. Ensure that `python 3.x` is already installed in your system. If not then install it.

This is because pygame is still not compatible with python 3.11 so we have to install its previous version.

open python in terminal

`import pygame`
-->to check if pygame is installed properly or not.

If you already have the above things done or you did it now.
You are good to go. 

Open the executable `play-snakes.py` file and enjoy the game and make sure to break the highest record...
