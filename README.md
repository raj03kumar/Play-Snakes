# Play-Snakes
The popular snake game which everybody has played atleast once in their life. If not then what are you waiting for. Download the repo and get started...

`pip install pygame --pre` to install pygame to your system. Ensure that python 3.x is already installed in your system.

This is because pygame is still not compatible with python 3.11 so we have to install its previous version.

open python in terminal

`import pygame`
-->to check if pygame is installed properly or not.

You are now good to go. 

Open the executable play-snakes.py file and enjoy the game and make sure to break the highest record...
